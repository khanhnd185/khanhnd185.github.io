# Affective Vocal Bursts (A-VB) Workshop and Competition

## Introduction

The Affective Vocal Bursts (A-VB) Workshop and Competition ([A-VB](https://www.competitions.hume.ai/avb2022)) was organized by [Hume AI](https://hume.ai/about), a research lab and technology company. The workshop explores an under-studied markers for emotion recognition, that is the human's non-verbal sound.

I (SclabCNU Team) paticipated in all 4 tasks of the competition and achieve top 2 in A-VB Culture task. The problem is designing a machine learning model to estimate the human behavior in different spaces. The detailed solution is described in my paper [Fine-tuning Wav2vec for Vocal-burst Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00263). The paper is in proceeding of [A-VB Workshop 2022](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15754).

I utilized the pre-trained [Wav2Vec 2.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477) provided by Pytorch audio library hub [here](https://pytorch.org/audio/0.11.0/pipelines.html#wav2vec-2-0-hubert-representation-learning)
