# A Transformer-based Approach to Video Frame-level Prediction in Affective Behavior Analysis In-the-wild

## Introduction

5th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild ([ABAW5](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/cvpr-2023-5th-abaw/))

Our report for the competition is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09293). The feature and trained models can be found in this [archive](https://ejnu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/nguyendangkhanh_jnu_ac_kr/EkrSGxjTG4JGvv49tw5vFngB_Kf5ia4TnsgblfJmLbt-9A?e=bb1nI8)

[Our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09293) is accepted at [11th International Conference on Big Data Applications and Services](http://www.kbigdata.or.kr/bigdas2023/index.html).

# Dependency

We borrow EfficientNet of Savchenko, we must use the exact version of timm:
```
pip install timm==0.4.5
```

The pre-trained EfficientNet B0 on  Facial Behavior Tasks of Savchenko is in [this project](https://github.com/HSE-asavchenko/face-emotion-recognition)
