Publications
--------------------

[Affective Behavior Analysis using Action Unit Relation Graph and Multi-task Cross Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10293)
:   In Proceeding of ECCV Workshop (2022)

    * The paper introduces my solution in the [4th Workshop and Competition on Affective Behavior Analysis in-the-wild](https://ibug.doc.ic.ac.uk/resources/eccv-2023-4th-abaw/). We achieve top 4 in the Multi-task Learning Challange.
    * We propose a 3-head EfficientNet to resolve 3 affective tasks: emotion recognition, valence-arousal estimation, and action unit detection.
    * Source code [here](https://github.com/khanhnd185/MTL-ABAW4).

[Fine-tuning Wav2vec for Vocal-burst Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00263)
:   In Proceeding of [ACII Affective Vocal Bursts Workshop and Competition 2022 (A-VB)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15754)
    * We utilize pre-trained Wav2vec to handle the Emotion Recognition from Vocal-burst. We achieve top 2 in A-VB Culture task.
    * The [competion](https://www.competitions.hume.ai/avb2022) is organized by [HumeAI](https://hume.ai/) to explore a under-studied indicator of emotion, the non-verbal sound of human.
    * Source code [here](https://github.com/khanhnd185/AVB2022).

[Analyzing Context and Speaker Memory using Pretrained Language Model for Emotion Recognition in Korean Conversation task](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c7N5KcWahmLxxS42UXhjY6CIjdcjh26o/view)
:   In Proceeding of [10th International Conference on Big Data Applications and Services](http://kbigdata.or.kr/bigdas2022/)
    * We achieve 4th Prize in the [4th Emotion Recognition in Korean Conversation Competition](https://sites.google.com/view/kerc2022/).
    * We use pre-trained language model to analyze the conversation context and the speakers' memory to handle the ERC task.
    * Source code [here](https://github.com/khanhnd185/KERC22).

[Multimodal Transformer for Automatic Depression Estimation System]()
:   In Proceeding of [The 29th International Workshop on Frontiers of Computer Vision](https://iwfcv2023.github.io/)
    * We reviewed the transformer-based fusion methods of [Xu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06488) for Depression recognition.
    * We introduce a new fusion transformer and get good performance on [D-Vlog Benchmark](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/21483).
    * Source code [here](https://github.com/khanhnd185/Transformer-fusion).
